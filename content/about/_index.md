The idea behind https://stories.univ.ai is to provide a permalinkable spot for 
small tweet threads on various subjects in Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, and AI.

My belief is that the size limitations on tweets force us to focus on whats important, and then
we can construct sequences of these concepts to create an explanation. The idea is that distillation
leads to clarity.

In the future we intend to open up the Stories site to other teachers and researchers, and let students
and others curate their own learning paths through these threads.

In the meanwhile though, we have arranged these threads by topics. Over time, we hope to be able to share
a considerable number of interesting tweet threads with you, so that this becomes a valuable learning
resource.

Thanks for reading!
