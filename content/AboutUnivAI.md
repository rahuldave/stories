1. I want to talk a bit about the company I've founded with Siddharth Das and other like minded professors. 
We founded Univ.AI <https://univ.ai> to teach Data Science and AI in a high quality, university-like way, but at 
much lower cost than college.

2. We have 3 flagship programs, starting Sep 19th, 2021. The first is a Certificate in 
Machine Learning and Data Science, and the second is a Certificate in Deep Learning. These 29 week programs will
make you super stong and employable in data science and AI respectively.

3. The third program combines these two together into a "Master Certificate", which trains you to become a jedi master in Data Science,
Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This is a longer, more intense program, taking 43 weeks. See <https://www.univ.ai/programs>!

4. We want our students to be well prepared for these programs, since a better prepared cohort results in better outcomes for everyone. Hence, we ask you to test to get into these programs, or take our pyDS course, which starts on the 9th of August.




5. pyDS <https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/> will train you to program in python, and at the same time, teach you the concepts of mathematics and statistics that you will need to succesfully complete our programs. pyDS only costs $100.

6.  pyDS is a great way to prepare, as well as sample our teaching style at a low cost. But even if you dont decide to take our programs, it is a great way to get upto speed with the pre-requisites required for any course or self-study in machine learning and AI.




7. How do we teach? LIVE, with lots of mentorship from your professors and teaching assistants. Lectures with exercises. Live labs to get hands-on practice on problems. Weekly or bi-weekly homework. A project at the end of each course. See <https://www.univ.ai/how-it-works>!

8. In short, a lot of work! On real world problems. But, you will do most of this work in groups, just as you would at a job. We'll provide a safe space for collaboration, and tons of mentoring. 
Still, you'll probably find that you will learn the most from each other!




9. Each of these 3 programs ends with the practicum course AI5 <https://welcome.univ.ai/AcceleratedMasters/ai5-c1/>. You'll learn how to make models production-ready, and then deploy them. Thus you will have ready to use real-world operations skills the moment you graduate.

10. You can take our programs (<https://www.univ.ai/programs>), or our courses ala-carte (<https://www.univ.ai/courses>), after taking our entrance test or taking pyDS. Our courses and programs are reasonably priced, more expensive than Coursera, but much cheaper than university.

11. For a limited time only, we are offering pyDS at $70 and AI-1 at $375, which I think are total steals. Sign up at <https://application.univ.ai/featured> and use code USQ3VO . Should you decide to take up a longer program afterwords, it's cost will also drop by the difference.

12. Our courses are a steal, given our great teachers, hands-on teaching model, and tons of mentorship! And, we have multiple payment options: pay as you go, income sharing agreement, or pay upfront at lower cost. See <https://www.univ.ai/tuition-options/int> for more details.
