1. Would you like to be able to learn Data Science or AI? These are multi-faceted subjects. How should you start? The best thing you could do to prepare yourself is to learn how to code, and code well, using python.

2. For instance, here is some code to carry out linear regression. Starts by opening a file and reading in the data, and ends with predicting the results and calculating a (loss) function on new data. Along the way, there are multiple programming concepts you must learn..

3. By learning these concepts, you will be ready for the thinking and the coding required to do more advanced tasks, such as representing images and operating on them!

4. At Univ.AI, we have carefully crafted a live and hands-on python course to make this learning easy for you. We are calling it pyDS. It starts on the 14th of August (this Saturday!), and runs for 5 weekends. See <https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/>.

5. With an investment of 90 minutes in class each weekend day for 5 weeks, you will progress from basic python programming to the implementation of statistical algorithms. Exercises and homework will reinforce your learning.

6. The course will be delivered by a crack team of practitioners, from the Stellar DNN research group. You can find out more about them and the course at <https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/>

7. Our company is founded on the premise that a good quality, university-like education can be made available at a reasonable cost. Thus we set the introductory price for pyDS to be quite low, at $100!

8. And, for a limited time only, we are running a promotion in which the price drops to $70! Sign up at <https://application.univ.ai/featured> and use code USQ3VO .




9. pyDS is a prerequisite (or you can take a test) for our other courses and programs. It is great preparation for self-study and other courses in AI as well! You can learn more at <https://stories.univ.ai/aboutfoundingunivai/>.
