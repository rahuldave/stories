1. Would you like to be able to learn Data Science or AI? These are multi-faceted subjects, but the best thing you could do to prepare yourself is to learn how to code, using python.

2. For instance, here is some code to carry out linear regression. Start by reading in the data, and ends with predicting the results on new data. Along the way, there are various programming concepts you must learn..

3. By learning these concepts, you�ll be ready for the thinking and the coding required to do more advanced tasks, such as representing images and operating on them!

4. At Univ.AI, we�ve carefully crafted a live and hands-on python course to make this learning easy for you. We�re calling it pyDS. It starts on the 14th of August, and runs for 5 weekends. See <https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/>.

5. With an investment of 90 minutes each weekend day, you�ll progress from basic python programming to the implementation of statistical algorithms. You will learn many python techniques along the way.

6. The course will be delivered by a crack team of practitioners, from the Stellar DNN research group led by @pprotopapas . You can find out more about them and the course at <https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/>

7. Our company is founded on the premise that a good-quality, university-like education can be made available at a reasonable cost. Thus we set the introductory price for pyDS to be low, at $100!.

8. And, for a limited time only, we are running a promotion in which the price drops to $70 ! Sign up at <https://application.univ.ai/featured> and use code USQ3VO .




9. pyDS is a prerequisite (or you can test in as well) for the other courses and programs we teach. Its great preparation for other courses or self-study as well! You can learn more at <https://stories.univ.ai/aboutunivai/> or read this thread: LINK.
