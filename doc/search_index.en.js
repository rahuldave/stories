When I finished my lectureship at Harvard in the middle of 2019, I decided to continue doing what I love most: teaching!\n\n\nAt Harvard I had the privilege of teaching cs109, the Harvard Data Science/ML/AI intro course, CS207, which I called Computer Science for Scientists, and AM207: Stochastic Methods and Bayesian Inference.\n\n\nSo, along with Siddharth Das (@sid_1973) and some other like minded professors, we founded in India, in late 2019 our company Univ.AI https://univ.ai to teach Data Science and AI in a high quality, university-like way, but at \nmuch lower cost than college.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am originally from India. My partner and I moved to India along with our then 3 1/2 year old. My partner is doing her Ph.D. on migrant female construction workers in India. So the timing really worked for us.\n\n\nWe trained two cohorts of incredible students in India. Our best students there were totally on par with\nthe best I trained at Harvard. And they were NOT all from eminent Indian technical Universities like the IITs.\n\n\nAs part of the first cohort, we ran a summer school. But soon, Covid pushed us to make our programs all online. This was not the original plan, but has in retrospect allowed us to be able to attract more diverse students, from all over India.\n\n\nFor example, we've taught a lot of women. Female participation in the workforce in India has\nactually decreased since the eighties ☹️. Seeing Indian women empower themselves with specialized education has been very heartening.\n\n\nOur students have gone on to great jobs, to do research, and to join good Masters Programs back in the US. Some of them became our teaching assistants for the next cohort. They turned out to be stellar teachers! I could not be prouder!\n\n\nAnd this leads me to think that we are missing a lot of talent, in India, in the US, and probably all over the world. It convinces me that that my original premise in starting Univ.AI: the democratization of high-quality university-style education is a GOOD THING to do.\n\n\nI am back in the US now. And we've just launched out first cohort here in the US, and globally. Our courses run live, with lots of hands-on work including exercises, labs, homework, and projects. tons of mentorship. This cohort starts on the 19th of September.\n\n\nYou can take our programs (https://www.univ.ai/programs) after taking our entrance test or taking pyDS. You can also take our courses ala-carte (https://www.univ.ai/courses)! Our courses and programs are reasonably priced, much cheaper than university.\n\n\n\n\nStarting this Saturday, the 14th of August, pyDS https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/ will train you to program in python, and at the same time, teach you the concepts of mathematics and statistics that you will need to succesfully complete our programs.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to sign up, we are, for a limited time, offering pyDS at $70 and AI-1 at $375, which I think are total steals. Use code USQ3VO at https://univ.ai/featured! Should you decide to take up a longer program after, it's cost will also drop by the difference.\n\n\nI'll be tweeting in more detail about our programs this week! Please feel free to at or DM me (@rahuldave). You can also access a permalink to this thread here: https://stories.univ.ai/aboutfoundingunivai/, should you like to bookmark it.\n\n\n","id":"https://stories.univ.ai/aboutfoundingunivai/","title":"About Founding Univ.AI"},"https://stories.univ.ai/aboutunivai/":{"body":"\nI want to talk a bit about the company I've founded with Siddharth Das and other like minded professors. \nWe founded Univ.AI https://univ.ai to teach Data Science and AI in a high quality, university-like way, but at \nmuch lower cost than college.\n\n\n\nWe have 3 flagship programs, starting Sep 19th, 2021. The first is a Certificate in \nMachine Learning and Data Science, and the second is a Certificate in Deep Learning. These 29 week programs will\nmake you super stong and employable in data science and AI respectively.\n\n\n\nThe third program combines these two together into a \"Master Certificate\", which trains you to become a jedi master in Data Science,\nMachine Learning, and Deep Learning. This is a longer, more intense program, taking 43 weeks. See https://www.univ.ai/programs!\n\n\n\n\nWe want our students to be well prepared for these programs, since a better prepared cohort results in better outcomes for everyone. Hence, we ask you to test to get into these programs, or take our pyDS course, which starts on the 9th of August.\n\n\npyDS https://welcome.univ.ai/Foundations/PyDS/ will train you to program in python, and at the same time, teach you the concepts of mathematics and statistics that you will need to succesfully complete our programs. pyDS only costs $100.\n\n\n\n\n\npyDS is a great way to prepare, as well as sample our teaching style at a low cost. But even if you dont decide to take our programs, it is a great way to get upto speed with the pre-requisites required for any course or self-study in machine learning and AI.\n\n\nHow do we teach? LIVE, with lots of mentorship from your professors and teaching assistants. Lectures with exercises. Live labs to get hands-on practice on problems. Weekly or bi-weekly homework. A project at the end of each course. See https://www.univ.ai/how-it-works!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, a lot of work! On real world problems. But, you will do most of this work in groups, just as you would at a job. We'll provide a safe space for collaboration, and tons of mentoring. \nStill, you'll probably find that you will learn the most from each other!\n\n\nEach of these 3 programs ends with the practicum course AI5 https://welcome.univ.ai/AcceleratedMasters/ai5-c1/. You'll learn how to make models production-ready, and then deploy them.

Did the \"intervention\" work?\n\n\n\nYou should ask: what is the size of the sample that underwent the intervention? To understand why, let us\ngo back to the tosses of a fair coin that we talked about here: https://twitter.com/rahuldave/status/1425883481821704192.\n\n\n\n\nThere, we increased the size of the sample of coins being tossed, and the fraction of heads, or the average of heads(1) and tails(0) got closer to 0.5 as the size N increased. We'd asked how fast does this fraction converge to 0.5?\n\n\nThis question is answered by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which, as it turns out, can also be used to answer the question about\nthe significance of the intervention! The CLT starts by recognizing that different samples of the same size N will have slightly different means.\n\n\nThe CLT says that these \"sample means\" follow a Normal Distribution whose standard\ndeviation decreases with increasing N. This standard deviation of sample means is called the standard error, and it is smaller than the underlying standard deviation σ of coin tosses.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if I take 1000 samples of size 500 each, the 100 means of the coin tosses distribute themselves according to the figure on the left. If I increase the size to 1000 tosses in a sample, we get the tighter distribution on the right.\n\n\n\n\nI talked about distributions in a previous thread: https://twitter.com/rahuldave/status/1428458696481247233. That thread describes the terms we use when we talk about distributions. Here, we are talking about the Gaussian or the Normal Distribution, which occurs everywhere in nature.\n\n\nThe Normal distribution N(µ, s) is symmetric about its mean µ, and 95% of the area of the distribution is between µ - 2s and µ + 2s. Lower s means smaller width; and the distribution becomes taller to compensate (keep the area at 1).\n\n\n\n\nAs we increase the sample size N, the distributions of sample means tighten (left image). You can see more blue dots closer in to the 0.5 value as N increases to 1000. We plot the mean µ of these sample means in the figure on the right. µ gets closer to 0.5 too.\n\n\n\nNow let us compute the standard error (standard deviation of sample means from µ), at any N. The CLT tells us that this width s decreases with N as 1/√N. We can now use this formula to answer the question about the weight reduction intervention.\n\n\n\n\nThe population's weights have a mean of 180 and a standard deviation of 9. Say you have a sample of 100 people in your intervention program. Then s = 9/√100 = 9/10 = 0.9. A set of samples of size 100 would have a mean of sample means of 180 and a standard error of 0.9. Tight!\n\n\nNow, if your intervention sample of size 100 had a mean weight of 175, that number is 5 standard errors from the population mean, and thus very unlikely to have come from a sample drawn from the population. What if you had chosen a sample of 9 people instead?\n\n\n\n\nThen s = 9/√9 = 9/3 = 3. Now, if your intervention sample of size 9 had a mean weight of 175, this is less than 2 standard errors out from the population mean, and you cannot claim with a sample size of 9 that your intervention sample actually had a significant effect.\n\n\n\n\nThus the CLT tells us the sample sizes we need to see significant effects!

The essence was that the mean of N random variables drawn from a distribution converge to the mean µ of the distribution as N becomes infinite.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that a random variable is one that can take multiple values, each with some probability. So if X represents the flip of a coin, it will take values Heads and Tails with some probability. We'll assign Heads the value 1 and Tails the value 0.\n\n\nThe probabilities attached to the values a random variable takes is called a distribution, or probability mass function (pmf). For a single fair coin, the \"Bernoulli\" Distribution attaches probabilities 0.5 to value 1 and 0.5 to value 0. These probabilities must add to 1.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bernoulli Distribution is a Discrete Distribution for a single coin toss with probability parameter µ. Its pmf associates a probability of µ with value 1. The LLN says that if you toss the coin N times, the fraction of heads converges to µ as N becomes infinite.\n\n\n\nAnother example of a discrete distribution is the Binomial Distribution. It answers the question: what is the probability of getting k heads in N coin tosses, given the intrinsic probability µ?\n\n\n\nFor example, what is the intrinsic probability of getting 2 out of 3 heads for a fair coin? The probability is (1/2)^2 for heads times (1/2) for tails (1/8), added up for the number of ways this can happen, which, as can be seen in the image, is 3. So 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8.\n\n\n\nThe probabilities of all the options in the pmf, that is k=0, k=1, k=2, and k=3 heads must add to 1. And if you repeated the experiment of tossing 3 coins N times, the LLN tells us that as N becomes infinite, the fraction of times you get 2 heads converges to 3/8.\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you change the coin bias or probability parameter to µ=0.7? Then heads is more likely as compared to the fair coin case. So the pmf shifts to higher probabilities for larger k.\n\n\n\npmf's tell us probabilities for our random variable. But, probability distributions are most useful when you use them to generate new data. For example, you might do simulations of 100 experiments of 3 coin tosses and see how many heads you get in each.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about a continuous random variable X, like the heights of people? In this case one defines a probability density function (pdf) p(x), the probability density that X=x (say 6 feet).\n\n\nThe area of an infinitesimally thin (width dx) rectangular sliver at X=x (yellow) with height the pdf p(x) is p(x)dx . This represents the probability that the random variable X has its value between x and x+dx. The sum of these areas in the range of X must be 1!\n\n\n\n\nThe area upto X=x (pink) is called the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) P(x). It is the probability that the random variable X has value less than or equal to x. P(x) must always between 0 and 1. For calculus lovers, the integral of the pdf upto x is the CDF.\n\n\n\nA famous continuous distribution is the Gaussian Distribution, arising in many real-life situations such as human weights, elections, etc. The pdf is much lower in values than the CDF, since the area under the pdf (NOT the sum of its values) must be 1.\n\n\n\nThe CDF can be defined for discrete probability distributions as well. There we simply add the probability upto and including x, rather than having to compute the area.\n\n\n\n\nDistributions are everywhere. For example, predicting elections and doing linear regression involve Gaussian Distributions. We'll tackle these in future tweet threads.

How might we produce such visualizations?\n\n\n\n\nWe'll tackle that question in another thread, but first we must learn how to make good plots using matplotlib. Which begs the question: what is a good visualization, and how can we make it?\n\n\nHere are some of the best practices for visualization. We'll talk about the second one today: Keep it simple!. As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said: Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\n\n\n\n\nAs @EdwardTufte has persuasively argued in his books, extraneous visual elements that distract from the message should be removed. For example: tick-marks, frames, sometimes even numbers! Lets us implement this process using matplotlib for a simple example...\n\n\n\nHere is a dataset on electoral votes and population in all the US states. We'll make a bar chart comparing the electoral votes of different states. You can find the data and the analysis notebook for this thread https://gist.github.com/rahuldave/2256465a8524453cb2a4630d336f82f7.\n\n\n\nThis first snippet illustrates Matplotlib's object-oriented API. We first create a figure object, and in the context of that object, an axes object. Then pandas is used to place a bar plot into those axes. What's not goodabout this plot?\n\n\n\nIn this picture taken from https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/navigating-matplotlib-tutorial-how-to/ by @brohrer, we see that (possibly multiple) Axes sit inside a Figure, and everything else (such as xaxis, yaxis, lines, patches, text, annotations) sits inside the Axes.\n\n\n\nHow can we improve our plot? Do we really need y-axis tick marks with state names labeling them? How about we remove these tick-marks? We do this in matplotlib by setting their length to 0. Note that we are not removing the ticks, but just the marks corresponding to them.\n\n\n\nDo we really need tick-marks on the x-axis? Why not just write the labels? And move these labels to the top where they are needed more, since the longest bars are there. Finally using a grid at the ticks helps us see the values on each and every bar!\n\n\n\nDo the spines add anything to our presentation? No! The elements of the figure are strong enough to stand by themselves. Ok, so lets remove the spines...\n\n\n\nIf you want to show more precise distinctions between the states' electoral votes, you want the grid to be more fine grained. So lets have a tick every 5 votes, which translates in our grid visual to a grid line every 5 votes.\n\n\n\nThe grid line labels look entirely redundant. After all, we can count off the grid-lines. So lets get rid of them, and eliminate the clutter. And then, why not show the user the electoral votes for each state at the end of its bar? Dont make the user think!\n\n\n\nThe annotation is done by putting down text at an x of 1 greater than the electoral votes and a y obtained as a index (increasing from top to bottom) from the way matplotlib handles bar plots. We then let matplotlib clean up the layouting of the plot to make it look crisper.\n\n\n\nMaybe you want to see this image in your slides or website based on the color scheme of your slides or site respectively, rather than having a white background. Then you can savefig the figure as a transparent png. There are multiple other save options as well.\n\n\n\n\nAn incredible source to learn the ins and outs of @matplotlib is https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/navigating-matplotlib-tutorial-how-to/ by @brohrer .

Then you have this intuition\nthat while you might get a streak of several heads in a row, in the long run the heads and tails are balanced.\n\n\nThis is actually an example of a famous law: the Law of Large numbers (LLN), which states that if you have\na random variable X with a mean, the average value of X over a sample of size N converges i.e. gets close and closer to this mean as\nN becomes larger and larger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LLN was first proved by Jakob Bernoulli in Ars Conjectandi, published posthumously by his nephew Niklaus Bernoulli, who appropriated entire passages of it for his treatise on law. It is the basis of much of modern statistics, including the Monte-Carlo method.\n\n\nLets parse the law. A random variable is one that can take multiple values, each with some probability. So if X represents the flip of a coin, it will take values Heads and Tails with some probability. We'll assign Heads the value 1 and Tails the value 0.\n\n\nThe probabilities attatched to the values a random variable takes is called a distribution, or probability mass function (pmf). For a fair coin, the \n\"Bernoulli\" Distribution attaches the probabilities 0.5 to value 1 and 0.5 to value 0. \nThese probabilities must add to 1.\n\n\n\n\nAn unfair coin thats more likely to land on heads might have a distribution where 0 has attached probability 0.4 and 1 has attached probability 0.6. In this case the mean µ of the distribution is 0.4 x 0 + 0.6 x 1 = 0.6.\n\n\n\n\nThis mean does not need to be\none of the allowed values of the distribution (here 0 and 1). The mean here simply indicates whats more likely: 0.6 means that heads is more likely than tails. What is the mean in the case of the fair coin?\n\n\nNow let us simulate the case of the fair coin. We'll toss a sample of N coins, or 1 coin N times, using the magic of numpy. We'll find the average of these N tosses. This is the fraction of heads! We'll plot this sample average against the sample size N.\n\n\n\n\nWe find that these sample averages are quite close to 0.5. And, as we increase the sample size N, these sample averages become super close to 0.5. Indeed, as N becomes infinite, the sample averages approach the mean µ=0.5. This is the Law of Large Numbers.\n\n\n\n\nThe LLN can be tautologically used to define the probability of a fair coin showing heads as the asymptotic (infinite N) sampling average. This is the frequentist definition of \"sampling probability\", the population frequency µ.\n\n\nBut we might also treat the mean µ as an intrinsic fraction of heads, a \"parameter\" of the Bernoulli distribution. Where does it come from in the first place? The value µ can be thought of as an \"inferential probability\" derived from symmetry and lack of knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a coin (2 sides, 2 possibilities), and no additional information about the coin and toss physics (thus fair), you would guess fraction µ=0.5 for heads. \nThe LLN then says that sampling probabilities converge to this \"inferential probability\".\n\n\nWe'll tackle fun questions that now arise, like how fast this sampling average converges to µ, how to calculate pi, and how the LLN enables random forests in future tweet threads.

Its a call to respect conventions for web elements, such as shopping carts (a cart should be on the upper right), so that the web experience is obvious to users.\n\n\n\n\nIn visualization, as in web development, your audience does not want to spend cognitive effort on things you could just show them, by convention, or by explicit writing.
