  	<div class="post-line"></div>
  	<p><img src="/aboutunivai/1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I want to talk a bit about the company I've founded with Siddharth Das and other like minded professors. 
We founded Univ.AI on the bet that a high quality, university-like education in Data Science and AI can 
be made available to folks at a much lower cost than college.</p>
<p><img src="/aboutunivai/2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We have 3 flagship programs, starting Sep 19th, 2021. Two of thesenda are a Certificate in 
Machine Learning and Data Science, and a Certificate in Deep Learning. These 29 week programs are designed to
make you super-employable in data science and AI respectively.</p>
<p><img src="/aboutunivai/3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We also combine these two together into a &quot;Master Certificate&quot;, which trains you to become a jedi master in Data Science,
Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This is a longer, more intense program, taking 43 weeks.</p>
<p><img src="/aboutunivai/4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We expect you to be well prepared for these programs..since an evenly prepared cohort results in better outcomes for everyone.
You can test to get into these programs, or do our pyDS course, which starts on the 9th of August. This is a great way to prepare, and even more importantly, a great way to sample our teaching style. pyDS only costs $100.</p>
<p>pyDS will provide you the prior training in programming python, and along with it, training in the concepts in mathematics and statistics, that you will need to succesfully complete our programs. But it is also a great way to get upto speed with the pre-requisites required for any course or self-study in machine learning and AI.</p>
<p><img src="/aboutunivai/6.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Our model of learning is LIVE lectures, with pre-, during, and post-lecure exercises. You will be doing live labs with teaching assistants to get hands-on practice on problems. You will work within groups in your cohort to do weekly or bi-weekly homework, and a project at the end of each course.</p>
<p>You will work in groups, just like you would at a job. We provide a safe space for discussion and collaboration, and a lot of
mentoring from our teaching assistants and professors. But you'll probably find that you will learn the most from each other!</p>
<p><img src="/aboutunivai/8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each of these programs ends with a practicum course, AI5, which is a project-driven finishing course in the productionizing and deployment of machine learning and deep learning models. This ensures that you have ready to use real-world operations skills the moment you graduate.</p>
